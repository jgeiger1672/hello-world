# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository, created for assignment #1 of my software engineering lab class. 

My name is Jared, and I am a Computer Science Major at FSU. This is my first time using GitHub, and this software engineering lab class will be my first real experience with creating my own software project. I am excited and looking forward to the work that I will do in this class.
